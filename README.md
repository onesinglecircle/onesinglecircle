- 👋 Hi, I’m @onesinglecircle
- 👀 I’m interested in using data from the world around us to tune (in real time) the tools we use to explore and enjoy it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning raspberry pi. I've got one running pi-hole and another with a sense-hat and these are my first real steps into coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a way to manipulate both sound and colour using real-world data.
